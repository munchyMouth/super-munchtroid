#### 2.6.1
2.6.1 Features special poses, a search bar, significant bug/palette fixes and frame by frame loading (ergo, massive performance boost)

#### 2.3.2
2.3.2 fixes the default lift pose's use of a redundant tile in Common Sprites by blanking the redundant tile. Also decouples the majority of CSS logic for compnents into separate files

#### 2.3.0

2.2.0 exposed all ROM statics in libs/TableData.json

#### 2.1.0
2.1.0 added a significant fix to file loading (which may improve performance as well as preventing crashes) and exposes the pose and palette json files so users can add their own custom data

### Installation

No installation required, simply execute as follows:

#### windows

*Requires Windows 10*
simply download, unzip and double-click on the `.exe` (in the unlikely, but not impossible, event that I have mixed things up and there is no `.exe`, check the Linux download link instead! If it has a `.exe`, that's the one you want!)

#### Linux

*Tested on Ubuntu 16, may not work on older distro's*
Download, unzip, navigate to the file directory in terminal and type the following within it:

```shell
./SPARTA
```

(pre-sparta:)
```shell
./Super\ Munchtroid
```
