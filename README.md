2.29.0 Features
- beam cursor management for sparks and beams
- massively improved palette controls and palette menu bug fixes
- the SPARTA Repointing Tool
- missile fin controls

(NOTE: Some fins are used for multiple poses; SPARTA only wires those poses up once. For a full list of missile fin poses, please visit http://patrickjohnston.org/bank/90#C9DD . *ALL* the addresses listed at that point in the code are Lo addresses that map to the PC addresses recorded in SPARTA's SamusPoses.json))

#### 2.20.2
2.20.2 Features

- shortcut `ctrl + o` to open files

#### 2.18.0

#### 2.3.2
2.3.2 fixes the default lift pose's use of a redundant tile in Common Sprites by blanking the redundant tile. Also decouples the majority of CSS logic for compnents into separate files

### Installation

No installation required, simply execute as follows:

#### windows

*Requires Windows 10*
simply download, unzip and double-click on the `.exe` (in the unlikely, but not impossible, event that I have mixed things up and there is no `.exe`, check the Linux download link instead! If it has a `.exe`, that's the one you want!)

#### Linux

*Tested on Ubuntu 16, may not work on older distro's*
Download, unzip, navigate to the file directory in terminal and type the following within it:

```shell
./SPARTA
```

(pre-sparta:)
```shell
./Super\ Munchtroid
```
