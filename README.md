2.30 Features:
- various bug fixes to repointing tool
- PC addresses exposed in repointing tool for tilemap
- additional special poses to cover low health tilemaps(!) and wall jump space jump/screw attack poses

2.29.3 patch:
Bug slipped through the net :/ so it goes sometimes. Fixed now.

2.29.2 patch:
I found a few wildcards in the missile offset stuff: some poses with 1 frame actually have 3 frames of missile coordinates! you need to run the overwrite save stuff on poses 6D, 6E, 6F and 70 to make sure that the coordinates work properly in those instances.

2.29.0 Features
- beam cursor management for sparks and beams
- massively improved palette controls and palette menu bug fixes
- the SPARTA Repointing Tool
- missile fin controls

(NOTE: Some fins are used for multiple poses; SPARTA only wires those poses up once. For a full list of missile fin poses, please visit http://patrickjohnston.org/bank/90#C9DD . *ALL* the addresses listed at that point in the code are Lo addresses that map to the PC addresses recorded in SPARTA's SamusPoses.json))

#### 2.20.2
2.20.2 Features
- arrow key control of vram (while focused)
- rotate 90Â° control for editor

- shortcut `ctrl + o` to open files

#### 2.18.0

#### 2.6.1

#### 2.3.2
2.3.2 fixes the default lift pose's use of a redundant tile in Common Sprites by blanking the redundant tile. Also decouples the majority of CSS logic for compnents into separate files

#### 2.3.0

#### 2.2.0
2.2.0 exposed all ROM statics in libs/TableData.json

#### 2.1.0
2.1.0 added a significant fix to file loading (which may improve performance as well as preventing crashes) and exposes the pose and palette json files so users can add their own custom data

#### 2.0.0 Beta
2.0.0 Beta. First release

### Installation

No installation required, simply execute as follows:

#### windows

*Requires Windows 10*
simply download, unzip and double-click on the `.exe` (in the unlikely, but not impossible, event that I have mixed things up and there is no `.exe`, check the Linux download link instead! If it has a `.exe`, that's the one you want!)

#### Linux

*Tested on Ubuntu 16, may not work on older distro's*
Download, unzip, navigate to the file directory in terminal and type the following within it:

```shell
./SPARTA
```

(pre-sparta:)
```shell
./Super\ Munchtroid
```
