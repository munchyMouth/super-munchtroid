THE LIBS FOLDER

The settings files in this folder control pretty much all of the stuff needed to load your ROM.

- SamusPoses.json contains the list of poses you find in the pose drop down menu
- PalettePointers.json contains the list of palettes you find in the palette drop down menu
- TableData.json is a complete list of every static pointer SMunch requires to load your ROM. Be extra careful when editing this file!

It is recommended that you run Munchtroid in Linux or from a command prompt if you wanna make major changes to TableData.json as some exception messages will only appear in a shell window.
